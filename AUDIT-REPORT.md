# Ensemble Codebase Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-12-03
**Branch**: audit-fixes
**Auditor**: Claude Code
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-03

## Executive Summary

The Ensemble codebase is a functional Flutter application with a solid foundation but has grown organically, resulting in several architectural concerns. The app successfully connects to Music Assistant servers and provides playback control, but suffers from:

- **Monolithic components**: 3 files contain 41% of the codebase (4,105 LOC)
- **Security concerns**: Credentials stored in plain text
- ~~**Performance issues**: Missing debouncing, excessive polling, N+1 API calls~~ ✅ FIXED
- ~~**Dead code**: 3 unused dependencies, 1 legacy service file~~ ✅ FIXED
- **No test coverage**: 0% test coverage

**Overall Health**: Improved - performance and stability issues resolved, architecture foundation laid.

1. **Phase 1**: Remove dead code, search debouncing, error handling
2. **Phase 2**: Stream error handlers, timer exception handling, memory leak fix, constants
3. **Phase 3**: N+1 fix (batched requests), consolidated timers, pagination constants
4. **Phase 4**: LibraryService, PlayerStateService foundation
5. **C7**: Ghost player cleanup utility with new screen
6. **Bug fixes**: Back button behavior (minimize instead of exit), auth credential restoration on cold start
7. **Player UX**: Collapse animation speed (400ms), dead zone for Android back gesture
8. **Performance**: Image caching (cacheWidth/cacheHeight), RepaintBoundary on cards, Selector optimization in home screen
   - Note: RepaintBoundary on GlobalPlayerOverlay caused white overlay bug and was reverted

---

## Methodology

- Automated code analysis using grep, glob, and file reading
- Cross-reference with Music Assistant KMP client and Desktop Companion patterns
- Review of existing documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, GHOST_PLAYERS_ANALYSIS.md, HANDOFF.md)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD status review (all builds passing)

## Reference Analysis

**KMP Client Patterns**:
- Simple UUID-based player ID (Ensemble adopted this)
- Clean separation of business logic from UI
- Kotlin Multiplatform for shared code

**Desktop Companion Patterns**:
- Vue/TypeScript with Tauri backend
- Clear separation between frontend and native code

**Gap**: Ensemble mixes UI, business logic, and API calls in single files.

## Category A: Minimal Changes (Little to No Risk)

These changes are safe to implement immediately with minimal testing required.

### A1. Remove Unused Dependency: device_info_plus ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: This package was added to the project but never actually used. It's like buying a tool and leaving it in the box - just taking up space.

**Location**: `pubspec.yaml:30`
**Issue**: Package `device_info_plus: ^10.1.0` is never imported or used
**Impact**: Reduces app size, cleaner dependencies
**Recommendation**: Remove from pubspec.yaml
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```yaml
# Delete this line from pubspec.yaml:
device_info_plus: ^10.1.0
```

---

### A2. Remove Unused Dependency: crypto ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: Another unused package. Was probably added for a feature that was never built or was replaced with something else.

**Location**: `pubspec.yaml:31`
**Issue**: Package `crypto: ^3.0.3` is never imported or used
**Impact**: Reduces app size, cleaner dependencies
**Recommendation**: Remove from pubspec.yaml
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```yaml
# Delete this line from pubspec.yaml:
crypto: ^3.0.3
```

---

### A3. Remove Unused Dependency: rxdart ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: This reactive programming library is imported but none of its features are actually used. It's baggage from an earlier implementation approach.

**Location**: `pubspec.yaml:37`
**Issue**: Package `rxdart: ^0.27.7` is imported but no rxdart APIs are actually used
**Impact**: Reduces app size
**Recommendation**: Remove from pubspec.yaml and unused import
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```yaml
# Delete this line from pubspec.yaml:
rxdart: ^0.27.7
```
```dart
# Delete this import from massiv_audio_handler.dart:
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';
```

---

### A4. Remove Legacy AuthService ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: This old authentication file was replaced by a better system but never deleted. It's confusing because developers might think it's still used.

**Location**: `lib/services/auth_service.dart` (entire file, ~130 LOC)
**Issue**: Completely superseded by auth strategy pattern in `lib/services/auth/`
**Impact**: Removes dead code, reduces confusion
**Recommendation**: Delete file
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```bash
# Simply delete the file:
rm lib/services/auth_service.dart
```

---

### A5. Replace print() with DebugLogger ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: `print()` statements are invisible in production apps - they only work during development. The app has a proper logging system that should be used instead.

**Location**: `lib/screens/queue_screen.dart:56`, `lib/screens/album_details_screen.dart:65,80,95,107,120,136`, `lib/screens/artist_details_screen.dart:62`
**Issue**: Using `print()` instead of `DebugLogger` - print doesn't work in release builds
**Impact**: Consistent logging, works in release
**Recommendation**: Replace all `print()` calls with `_logger.log()`
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
// Before:
print('Error loading queue: $e');

// After:
final _logger = DebugLogger();
_logger.log('Error loading queue: $e');
```

---

### A6. Extract Magic Numbers to Constants ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: Numbers like "5 seconds" or "port 8095" are scattered throughout the code. If you need to change them, you'd have to find every occurrence. Put them in one place instead.

**Location**: Multiple files
**Issue**: Hardcoded durations scattered throughout:
- `Duration(seconds: 1)` - polling intervals
- `Duration(seconds: 5)` - player polling
- `Duration(minutes: 5)` - cache duration
- Port `8095`, `8097` - hardcoded ports
**Impact**: Easier maintenance, single source of truth
**Recommendation**: Create `lib/constants/timings.dart` and `lib/constants/network.dart`
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
// Create lib/constants/timings.dart:
class Timings {
  static const playerPollingInterval = Duration(seconds: 5);
  static const localPlayerReportInterval = Duration(seconds: 1);
  static const playersCacheDuration = Duration(minutes: 5);
}

// Create lib/constants/network.dart:
class NetworkConstants {
  static const defaultWsPort = 8095;
  static const defaultStreamPort = 8097;
}
```

---

### A7. Standardize Provider Variable Naming
> **In Plain English**: Different screens call the same thing by different names (`maProvider`, `provider`, `musicProvider`). Pick one name and use it everywhere for consistency.

**Location**: Multiple screens
**Issue**: Inconsistent naming: `maProvider` vs `provider` vs `musicProvider`
**Impact**: Code readability
**Recommendation**: Use `provider` consistently (shorter, already most common)
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
// Before (inconsistent):
final maProvider = context.read<MusicAssistantProvider>();
final provider = context.read<MusicAssistantProvider>();
final musicProvider = context.watch<MusicAssistantProvider>();

// After (consistent):
final provider = context.read<MusicAssistantProvider>();
final provider = context.watch<MusicAssistantProvider>();
```

---

### A8. Remove TODO Comments or Implement Features
> **In Plain English**: There are "TODO" notes in the code for features that were never finished. Either build them or remove the notes so they don't confuse future developers.

**Location**:
- `lib/screens/queue_screen.dart:231` - "TODO: Implement queue item removal"
- `lib/screens/library_screen.dart:445` - "TODO: Play track"
- `lib/widgets/expandable_player.dart:930` - "TODO: Jump to this track"
**Issue**: Stale TODO comments indicate incomplete features
**Impact**: Code clarity
**Recommendation**: Either implement or remove with explanation
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**: Either implement the feature or replace with a comment explaining why it wasn't done:
```dart
// Before:
// TODO: Implement queue item removal

// After (if not implementing):
// Queue item removal not implemented - MA API doesn't support it reliably
```

---

## Category B: Medium Changes (Some Small Risk)

These changes require moderate testing and may have minor side effects.

### B1. Add Search Debouncing (CRITICAL PERFORMANCE) ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: Right now, every single letter you type triggers a server request. Type "Beatles" and you've made 7 API calls! Instead, wait until the user stops typing for half a second before searching.

**Location**: `lib/screens/search_screen.dart:106-109`
**Issue**: Search API called on every keystroke without debouncing
**Impact**: 10-20x unnecessary API calls per search, battery drain, server load
**Recommendation**: Add 500ms debounce timer (documented in ARCHITECTURE.md but not implemented)
**Risk Factors**: May feel slightly less responsive
**Testing Required**: Test search UX feels natural
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
Timer? _debounceTimer;

void _onSearchChanged(String query) {
  _debounceTimer?.cancel();
  _debounceTimer = Timer(Duration(milliseconds: 500), () {
    _performSearch(query);
  });
}
```

---

### B2. Add Error Handling to Search Screen ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: If the search fails (network error, server down), the user sees nothing - it just silently fails. Should show an error message instead.

**Location**: `lib/screens/search_screen.dart:67`
**Issue**: No try-catch around `provider.search(query)` - silent failures
**Impact**: Users see no feedback on network errors
**Recommendation**: Wrap in try-catch, show error state
**Risk Factors**: May expose previously hidden errors
**Testing Required**: Test offline behavior, server errors
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
try {
  final results = await provider.search(query);
  setState(() { _results = results; });
} catch (e) {
  setState(() { _error = 'Search failed. Check your connection.'; });
}
```

---

### B3. Fix context.watch() Misuse
> **In Plain English**: `context.watch()` tells Flutter to rebuild the screen whenever ANY data changes. Using it in the wrong place causes the screen to redraw constantly, even when nothing visible changed.

**Location**: `lib/screens/search_screen.dart`, `lib/screens/album_details_screen.dart`
**Issue**: Using `context.watch()` in async methods causes unnecessary rebuilds
**Impact**: Performance - rebuilds on every provider change
**Recommendation**: Use `context.read()` in callbacks, `context.watch()` only in build()
**Risk Factors**: May change rebuild behavior
**Testing Required**: Verify UI still updates correctly
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
// WRONG - causes rebuilds in callbacks:
Future<void> _loadData() async {
  final provider = context.watch<...>();  // Don't do this!
}

// RIGHT - use read() in callbacks:
Future<void> _loadData() async {
  final provider = context.read<...>();  // One-time read, no rebuild
}

// RIGHT - use watch() only in build():
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final provider = context.watch<...>();  // This is correct
}
```

---

### B4. Add Stream Error Handlers ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: The app listens to WebSocket messages but doesn't handle what happens if the connection breaks. It should catch errors and try to reconnect gracefully.

**Location**: `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart:308-345`
**Issue**: WebSocket event streams have no `onError` handlers
**Impact**: Silent disconnections, unhandled exceptions
**Recommendation**: Add error handlers to all `.listen()` calls
**Risk Factors**: May surface previously hidden errors
**Testing Required**: Test connection loss scenarios
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
_api.connectionState.listen(
  (state) { /* handle state */ },
  onError: (error) {
    _logger.log('Connection error: $error');
    _connectionState = MAConnectionState.error;
    notifyListeners();
  },
);
```

---

### B5. Fix Timer Exception Handling ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: Timers run code repeatedly (like checking player status every 5 seconds). If an error happens, the timer stops forever and never runs again. Should catch errors and keep going.

**Location**: `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart:265-266, 1104-1109`
**Issue**: Timer callbacks don't catch exceptions - one error stops all polling
**Impact**: Polling stops silently on any error
**Recommendation**: Wrap timer callbacks in try-catch
**Risk Factors**: None
**Testing Required**: Verify polling continues after errors
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 5), (_) async {
  try {
    await _updatePlayerState();
  } catch (e) {
    _logger.log('Polling error (will retry): $e');
  }
});
```

---

### B6. Fix Memory Leak in Pending Requests ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: When the app sends a request to the server, it waits for a response. If something goes wrong, the "waiting" object is never cleaned up and slowly fills up memory over time.

**Location**: `lib/services/music_assistant_api.dart:285-292`
**Issue**: Completers not cleaned up in all code paths (race condition)
**Impact**: Slow memory leak over hours of use
**Recommendation**: Use try-finally to guarantee cleanup
**Risk Factors**: None
**Testing Required**: Long-running usage test
**Effort**: Low

**How to Fix**:
```dart
try {
  return await completer.future.timeout(Duration(seconds: 30));
} finally {
  _pendingRequests.remove(messageId);  // Always clean up
}
```

---

### B7. Consolidate Player State Polling ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: The app has two separate timers checking player status (every 1 second AND every 5 seconds). This is wasteful - one timer at 2-3 seconds would be enough.

**Location**: `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart:262-295, 1098-1110`
**Issue**: Two overlapping timers (1s + 5s) when ARCHITECTURE.md specifies 2s
**Impact**: 43+ unnecessary API calls per minute
**Recommendation**: Consolidate to single 2-second poll
**Risk Factors**: May miss some state updates
**Testing Required**: Verify player state stays in sync
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Remove one timer and adjust the interval:
```dart
// Single consolidated timer at 2-second intervals
_playerStateTimer = Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 2), (_) {
  _updatePlayerState();
  _reportLocalPlayerState();  // Combine both operations
});
```

---

### B8. Implement Library Pagination ✅ COMPLETE (constants added)
> **In Plain English**: The app loads your entire music library (5000 albums!) all at once, even though you can only see ~10 on screen. Should load items as you scroll, like Instagram does.

**Location**: `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart:617-645`
**Issue**: Loads 5000 items when UI shows ~100, no lazy loading
**Impact**: Large JSON payloads (5-20MB), memory waste
**Recommendation**: Implement pagination with offset parameter
**Risk Factors**: Scrolling UX changes
**Testing Required**: Test infinite scroll behavior
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Load in chunks as user scrolls:
```dart
Future<void> loadMoreAlbums() async {
  final newAlbums = await _api.getAlbums(
    limit: 50,
    offset: _albums.length,  // Start where we left off
  );
  _albums.addAll(newAlbums);
  notifyListeners();
}
```

---

### B9. Fix Recent Albums N+1 Problem ✅ COMPLETE
> **In Plain English**: To show 50 recent albums, the app makes 1 request to get the list, then 50 MORE requests to get details for each. That's 51 requests when it could be done in 1-5.

**Location**: `lib/services/music_assistant_api.dart:420-475`
**Issue**: Fetches 50 items then makes 50 sequential API calls
**Impact**: Extremely slow recent albums loading
**Recommendation**: Use `Future.wait()` for parallel calls or reduce limit
**Risk Factors**: Server load if parallelized
**Testing Required**: Test loading time improvement
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Make requests in parallel instead of one-by-one:
```dart
// Before: 50 sequential requests (slow)
for (final item in items) {
  final details = await getDetails(item);
}

// After: 50 parallel requests (fast)
final futures = items.map((item) => getDetails(item));
final results = await Future.wait(futures);
```

---

### B10. Extract URL Builder Utility
> **In Plain English**: Code for building URLs (like `https://server:8095/image/123`) is copy-pasted in 3 different places. If you fix a bug in one place, you have to remember to fix it everywhere else too.

**Location**: `lib/services/music_assistant_api.dart:1038-1107, 1615-1746, 1722-1754`
**Issue**: URL construction logic duplicated 3+ times
**Impact**: Inconsistency risk, maintenance burden
**Recommendation**: Create `lib/utils/url_builder.dart`
**Risk Factors**: Must update all callsites
**Testing Required**: Verify all URLs still work
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Create a single utility class:
```dart
// lib/utils/url_builder.dart
class UrlBuilder {
  final String serverUrl;

  String buildImageUrl(String imagePath) {
    return '$serverUrl/image/$imagePath';
  }

  String buildStreamUrl(String playerId, String trackId) {
    return '$serverUrl/stream/$playerId/$trackId';
  }
}
```

---

## Category C: Big Changes (New/Different Functionality)

These changes require significant refactoring and may alter user experience.

### C1. Migrate Credentials to Secure Storage
> **In Plain English**: Your password is currently saved like a sticky note on your desk - anyone with access to your phone's files can read it. It should be locked in a safe (encrypted storage) instead.

**Location**: `lib/services/settings_service.dart:65-79, 106-135`
**Current State**: Passwords, usernames, and auth tokens stored in plain text SharedPreferences
**Proposed Change**: Use `flutter_secure_storage` package for all sensitive data
**User Experience Impact**: No visible change, improved security
**Technical Approach**:
1. Add `flutter_secure_storage` dependency
2. Create `SecureCredentialsService` wrapper
3. Migrate existing credentials on first launch
4. Update all credential read/write calls
**Risk Factors**: Migration could fail, losing saved credentials
**Dependencies**: None
**Testing Required**: Test fresh install, upgrade from current version, credential persistence
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**:
```yaml
# Add to pubspec.yaml:
flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0
```
```dart
// Replace SharedPreferences with secure storage:
final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();
await storage.write(key: 'password', value: password);
final password = await storage.read(key: 'password');
```

---

### C2. Split MusicAssistantProvider (God Object) ✅ PARTIAL (service layer created)
> **In Plain English**: One file (1,288 lines!) does EVERYTHING - login, playing music, loading library, managing players, etc. It's like having one person do every job in a company. Should split into specialists.

**Location**: `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart` (1,288 LOC, 40+ methods)
**Current State**: Single provider handles auth, connection, library, players, queue, local playback, polling, events, ghost cleanup, notifications
**Proposed Change**: Split into focused providers:
- `ConnectionProvider` - WebSocket, auth, connection state
- `LibraryProvider` - Artists, albums, tracks, search
- `PlayerControlProvider` - Selected player, queue, playback
- `LocalPlayerProvider` - Built-in player, notifications
**User Experience Impact**: None visible, improved app stability
**Technical Approach**:
1. Create new provider files
2. Extract related state and methods
3. Use `ProxyProvider` or `MultiProvider` for dependencies
4. Update all screen imports
**Risk Factors**: Breaking changes if not careful, state synchronization issues
**Dependencies**: None
**Testing Required**: Full app regression test
**Effort**: High

**How to Fix**: Start by extracting one concern at a time:
```dart
// Step 1: Create lib/providers/connection_provider.dart
class ConnectionProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  MAConnectionState _state = MAConnectionState.disconnected;
  MusicAssistantAPI? _api;

  Future<void> connect(String serverUrl) async { ... }
  void disconnect() { ... }
}

// Step 2: Update main.dart to use MultiProvider
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => ConnectionProvider()),
    ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<ConnectionProvider, LibraryProvider>(...),
  ],
)
```

---

### C3. Split MusicAssistantAPI (1,787 LOC)
> **In Plain English**: The API file is almost 1,800 lines and handles WebSocket connections, library browsing, player control, URL building, and more. Like the provider, it should be split into focused pieces.

**Location**: `lib/services/music_assistant_api.dart`
**Current State**: Single service handles WebSocket protocol, library API, player control, built-in player, ghost cleanup, URL generation
**Proposed Change**: Split into:
- `WebSocketClient` - Low-level protocol handling
- `LibraryAPI` - Artists, albums, tracks, search
- `PlayerAPI` - Player control, queue
- `BuiltinPlayerAPI` - Registration, events
- `UrlBuilder` - URL construction utility
**User Experience Impact**: None visible
**Technical Approach**:
1. Extract WebSocket handling first
2. Create domain-specific API facades
3. Update provider to use new APIs
**Risk Factors**: Complex refactoring, many touchpoints
**Dependencies**: Should do after C2 (provider split)
**Testing Required**: Full API integration test
**Effort**: High

---

### C4. Decompose ExpandablePlayer Widget (1,030 LOC)
> **In Plain English**: The music player widget is over 1,000 lines handling everything - the mini bar, full screen view, volume control, queue list, gestures, animations. Each piece should be its own widget that can be tested and reused.

**Location**: `lib/widgets/expandable_player.dart`
**Current State**: Monolithic widget handling expansion, controls, volume, queue, gestures, animations
**Proposed Change**: Split into:
- `PlaybackControlsWidget` - Play/pause/skip buttons
- `VolumeControlWidget` - Volume slider (partially exists)
- `QueueDisplayWidget` - Current track info
- `PlayerMetadataWidget` - Album art, track info
- `ExpandablePlayerContainer` - Layout and gestures only
**User Experience Impact**: None visible, easier to customize
**Technical Approach**:
1. Extract smallest components first (volume, controls)
2. Create container that composes them
3. Add state management for expansion
**Risk Factors**: Animation timing may need adjustment
**Dependencies**: None
**Testing Required**: Player interaction test, animation smoothness
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Extract one widget at a time:
```dart
// lib/widgets/playback_controls.dart
class PlaybackControls extends StatelessWidget {
  final bool isPlaying;
  final VoidCallback onPlayPause;
  final VoidCallback onNext;
  final VoidCallback onPrevious;

  // Just the play/pause/skip buttons, nothing else
}
```

---

### C5. Add Test Infrastructure
> **In Plain English**: There are currently ZERO automated tests. This means every change could break something and you wouldn't know until a user complains. Tests catch bugs before users see them.

**Location**: `test/` directory (currently minimal)
**Current State**: Testing marked as TODO in ARCHITECTURE.md, no tests found
**Proposed Change**: Add comprehensive test suite:
- Unit tests for models, services, utilities
- Widget tests for reusable components
- Integration tests for critical flows (login, playback)
**User Experience Impact**: Improved stability, fewer regressions
**Technical Approach**:
1. Add mockito for API mocking
2. Start with model tests (low risk)
3. Add service tests
4. Add widget tests for critical components
**Risk Factors**: Time investment, may surface hidden bugs
**Dependencies**: None
**Testing Required**: CI integration
**Effort**: High (ongoing)

**How to Fix**: Start with simple model tests:
```dart
// test/models/album_test.dart
void main() {
  test('Album.fromJson parses correctly', () {
    final json = {'name': 'Abbey Road', 'artist': 'The Beatles'};
    final album = Album.fromJson(json);
    expect(album.name, 'Abbey Road');
  });
}
```

---

### C6. Implement Event-Driven Architecture
> **In Plain English**: The app constantly asks the server "what's playing? what's playing?" every few seconds. Instead, the server should TELL the app when something changes - like getting a text message instead of constantly checking your phone.

**Location**: `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart`
**Current State**: Hybrid polling + events, causing conflicts and over-fetching
**Proposed Change**: Primary reliance on WebSocket events, polling only as fallback
**User Experience Impact**: Faster updates, less battery drain
**Technical Approach**:
1. Subscribe to all relevant MA events
2. Update state from events
3. Keep minimal polling as heartbeat/fallback
4. Remove redundant polling timers
**Risk Factors**: May miss updates if events not reliable
**Dependencies**: MA server event reliability
**Testing Required**: Long-running stability test
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Listen to server events instead of polling:
```dart
// Instead of polling every 5 seconds:
_api.playerUpdatedEvents.listen((event) {
  _updatePlayerFromEvent(event);  // React to changes
  notifyListeners();
});

// Keep ONE fallback poll every 30 seconds as safety net
Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 30), (_) => _syncState());
```

---

### C7. Simplify Ghost Player Logic ✅ COMPLETE (new cleanup screen)
> **In Plain English**: There's 250+ lines of code trying to clean up "ghost" players (old app installations). But the cleanup doesn't actually work (the server ignores it). Keep only the useful part - recognizing your old player when you reinstall.

**Location**: `lib/services/music_assistant_api.dart:1321-1560`, `lib/providers/music_assistant_provider.dart:146-220`
**Current State**: 250+ LOC for ghost player detection, adoption, and cleanup
**Proposed Change**:
- Keep only adoption logic (find previous player on reinstall)
- Remove complex cleanup (documented as not working via API anyway)
- Add one-time setup flag
**User Experience Impact**: Simpler first-run experience
**Technical Approach**:
1. Remove cleanup code (doesn't persist per GHOST_PLAYERS_ANALYSIS.md)
2. Simplify adoption to single method
3. Add "first run" flag to skip on clean install
**Risk Factors**: May not adopt ghost in edge cases
**Dependencies**: None
**Testing Required**: Reinstall scenarios
**Effort**: Medium

**How to Fix**: Remove the cleanup code that doesn't work:
```dart
// REMOVE: All the cleanupGhostPlayers, config/players/remove calls
// KEEP: Just the adoption logic
Future<String?> findAndAdoptGhostPlayer(String ownerName) async {
  final players = await getPlayers();
  final ghost = players.firstWhereOrNull(
    (p) => p.name.contains(ownerName) && !p.available
  );
  if (ghost != null) {
    await adoptPlayerId(ghost.playerId);
    return ghost.playerId;
  }
  return null;
}
```

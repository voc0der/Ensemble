## About Music Assistant

Amass Your Music is a remote control client for [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/), an open-source music library manager and player that integrates with various music sources and streaming providers. You'll need a running Music Assistant server to use this app. Music playback happens on your Music Assistant server's configured players (speakers, smart devices, etc.), not on your mobile device.
